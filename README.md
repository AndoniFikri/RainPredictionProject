# RainPredictionProject

This time we tried to model a rain prediction classifier using Australia Weather Data Set. This was part of my Data Science program held by Hacktiv8. The model that my team created has an overall AUC Score of 0.84 and we have deployed the model using Heroku. Feel free to access the link below to have fun!
